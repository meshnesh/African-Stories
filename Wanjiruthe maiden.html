		<p>
			The sun blazed upon the earth; there was no rain. </p>
 
		<p>The crops died and hunger was manifest among the people.</p>
 
		<p>This happened one year, again the next, and then for a third year.</p>
 
		<p>So the people gathered at the praying place, and asked of each other the reason for their plight; then the question was posed to the Medicine-Man.</p>
 
<p>He spilled his gourd of its contents, upon the ground again and again.</p>

<p>Then he declared that the rains would come only when the maiden Wanjiru was bought.</p>

<p>He told them that each, from the youngest lad to the oldest man, must bring, on the appointed day, a goat to purchase Wanjiru from her family.</p>
 
<p>The day arrived, and all the people were present, with each man leading a goat.</p>

<p>The people gathered in a circle, and the relations of Wanjiru stood together, and she herself stood in the middle.</p>

<p>As they stood there, Wanjiru began to sink into the ground.</p>
 
<p>Soon she was in up to her knees. She cried, "I am lost!" The people pressed close and placed goats in the keeping of Wanjiru's parents.</p>

<p>She sank lower to her waist. Again she cried out, "I am lost but much rain will fall!" More goats were thrust upon her family.</p>

<p>She sank to her breast, and still no rain came. Wanjiru cried out another time, "A great rain will come!"</p>

<p>Now she sank to her neck, and then the rain poured down.</p>

<p>The people should have come forward to save her, but instead they placed more goats upon the family. </p>
 
<p>Then Wanjiru said, "My people have undone me", and she sank down to her eyes.</p>

<p>As one or another of her family moved toward her to save her, another of the people would present him or her with a goat and that family member would step back. </p>
 
<p>Wanjiru cried out for the last time, "My own family has undone me!" Then she sank from sight.</p>

<p>The rain poured down in a great deluge and the people hurried for shelter in their homes.</p>

<p>There was a young warrior who lamented the loss of Wanjiru.</p>

<p>He swore to find her and bring her back. He wandered for a long time, and eventually returned to the spot where Wanjiru had disappeared. </p>
 
<p>Here as he stood where she had stood, he slowly began to sink into the ground; and he sank lower and lower until the ground closed over him.</p>
 
<p>He found himself on a road beneath the ground, and as he trod down the road he came upon Wanjiru, all muddy and dishevelled, and without her clothing which had disintegrated.</p>

<p>He picked her up and carried her upon his back to where they had sunk beneath the ground. </p>
 
<p>Here they rose up together into the open air.</p>

<p>He took her to his mother's house, where she was fed the fat from slaughtered goats and clothed with their skins, until she, again, was beautiful and well-dressed. </p>
 
<p>It came to pass that the village was having a dance, and she and her warrior attended.</p>
 
<p>When her family saw her, they attempted to approach her, but her lover beat them off. </p>
 
<p>When her family made repeated attempts to see her over the course of the next few days, the warrior repented.</p>
 
<p>He paid the family the purchase price (labola) and allowed them to reconcile. </p>
